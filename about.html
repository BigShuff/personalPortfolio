                    <h2>Early Years</h2>
                    It was in my final year at school when I saw my first computer, my classmates and I stared at it
                    bewilderingly whilst
                    listening to our science teacher attempt to explain what it was. In those distant days from the 70’s
                    small programs where
                    punched out on data cards, it was the concept of these cards that stole my interest. It was in the
                    early 80’s when I was
                    working as a Quality Control Engineer that I decided to purchase a study from home computer course
                    studying an early
                    version of the C programming language. 
                    <h2>Off To College</h2>
                    It wasn’t until 1992 the very early years of the World Wide Web. after 
                    a rather messy divorce, I decided to go back to college
                    on a full time basis to study information technology the subject that had now captivated me
                    completely.
                    Why Website Design?
                    It was those early computer applications we worked with at college on the early Microsoft Windows
                    operating system that
                    totally changed the subject for just about everyone now we were working from a GUI (Graphical User
                    Interface). One program
                    in particular that really interested me it was a Desktop Publishing program called ‘Pagemaker’, it
                    was for designing page
                    layouts and styling images and text on printed pages. During recent years of course the biggest call
                    for layout of text and
                    images has been website design, which is exactly how it has all happened for me. 
                    I went on to attend university and gain my
                    HND in Computer Systems Engineering and a Post Graduate Diploma for Office Systems & Data
                    Communication.
                    <h2>Off To Work</h2>
                    After college I took a position in Wellingborough at a company called Computer Productivity Ltd, as
                    a computer programmer.
                    Shortly after in the late part of the 90s I took a contracting post in Galway Republic of Ireland
                    working on a millennium
                    project for a medical insurance company across the pond in New York.</p>

                    <h2>My Own Business</h2>
                    In 2005 I opened up a small business of my own, not in computing however but in the second love of
                    my life, music and sound.
                    I learnt a huge amount about the trials of a small business owner and I have to admit I also made a
                    few mistakes along the way.
                    It can be very easy to view a new business through rose coloured spectacles, and I certainly did, by
                    overestimating my target
                    audience. However my experience in business back then has helped me to understand the challenges of
                    those small business
                    owners I speak with today.
                    <h2>Updating My Education & Skills</h2>
                    I have recently been renewing and refreshing my skills over the last couple of years as a student of
                    Codecademy, widely
                    considered to be the best online learning platforms for coders and IT professionals. I am currently
                    studying Full Stack Website
                    Engineering full stack simply means capable of working both client and server side.</p>
