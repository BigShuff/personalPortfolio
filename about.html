                <p class="text">
                    It was in my final year at school when I saw my first computer, my classmates and I stared at it
                    bewilderingly whilst listening to our science teacher attempt to explain what it was. In those
                    distant days from the 70’s small programs where punched out on data cards, it was the concept of
                    these cards that stole my interest. It was in the early 80’s when I was working as a Quality Control
                    Engineer that I decided to purchase a study from home, computer course. Studying an early version of
                    the C programming language.

                <h2 class="inAreaOne">Off To College</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    It wasn’t until 1992 in the World Wide Webs junior years and after a rather messy divorce, I decided
                    to go back to college on a full time basis to study information technology the subject that had now
                    captivated me completely.
                <h2 class="inAreaOne">Why Website Design?</h2>
                <p class="text">It was those early computer applications we worked with at college on the early
                    Microsoft Windows operating system that
                    totally changed the subject for just about everyone now we were working from a GUI (Graphical User
                    Interface). One program in particular that really interested me it was a Desktop Publishing program
                    called ‘Pagemaker’, it
                    was for designing page layouts and styling images and text on printed pages. During recent years of
                    course the biggest call for layout of text and images has been website design, which is exactly how
                    it has all happened for me.
                    I went on to attend university and gain my HND in Computer Systems Engineering and a Post Graduate
                    Diploma for Office Systems & Data Communication.

                <h2>Off To Work</h2>
                <p class="textRight">
                    After college I took a position in Wellingborough at a company called Computer Productivity Ltd, as
                    a computer
                    programmer. shortly after in the late part of the 90s I took a contracting post in Galway Republic
                    of Ireland working
                    on a millennium project for a medical insurance company across the pond in New York.

                <h2>My Own Business</h2>
                <p class="textRight">
                    In 2005 I opened up a small business of my own, not in computing however but in the second love of
                    my life, music and sound. I learnt a huge amount about the trials of a small business owner and I
                    have to admit I also made a few mistakes along the way. It can be very easy to view a new business
                    through rose coloured spectacles, and I certainly did, by overestimating my revenue and not getting
                    my pricing right. However my experience in business back then has helped me to understand the
                    challenges of those small business owners I speak with today.

                <h2>Updating My Education & Skills</h2>
                <p class="textRight">
                    I have recently been renewing and refreshing my skills over the last couple of years as a student of
                    Codecademy, widely considered to be the best online learning platforms for coders and IT
                    professionals. I am currently studying Full Stack Website Engineering full stack simply means
                    capable of working both client and server side.
